❤️ Heart Disease Detection using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease using machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, and training multiple classification models to evaluate performance. The models are assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to identify the most effective approach for heart disease detection.
